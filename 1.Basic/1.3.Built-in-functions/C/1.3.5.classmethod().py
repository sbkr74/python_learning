'''
It's commonly used to define methods that act on the class itself or on class-level data.
The primary use cases for classmethod() include:
    1.) Alternative Constructors: Class methods can be used as alternative constructors. 
        For example, a class method can parse a string and create an instance of the class based on the parsed data.
    2.) Factory Methods: They can act as factory methods that return instances of the class based on certain conditions.
    3.) Accessing Class Variables: They are useful for accessing or modifying class variables that are 
        shared among all instances of the class.
