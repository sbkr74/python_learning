The `hash()` function in Python is used to obtain the hash value of an object, which is an integer. Hash values are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup. Hash values are particularly useful for objects that need to be stored in hash tables, such as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets.

### Basic Usage

The `hash()` function works on immutable data types such as numbers, strings, and tuples (if they only contain hashable types). Lists and dictionaries, being mutable, cannot be hashed.

#### Example 1: Hashing Numbers and Strings

```python
# Hashing an integer
num_hash = hash(42)
print(num_hash)  # Output: 42 (or another consistent integer hash value)

# Hashing a string
string_hash = hash("Hello, World!")
print(string_hash)  # Output: A consistent integer hash value
```

#### Example 2: Hashing Tuples

```python
# Hashing a tuple
tuple_hash = hash((1, 2, 3))
print(tuple_hash)  # Output: A consistent integer hash value
```

### Real-Life Scenario: Using Hash Values in a Set

Sets in Python are implemented using hash tables, which means that when you add an element to a set, its hash value is calculated and used to determine its position in the set. This allows for fast membership tests and retrievals.

#### Example: Storing Unique User IDs in a Set

Suppose you are managing user IDs in a system and want to ensure all user IDs are unique. You can use a set to store these IDs since sets automatically handle uniqueness and use hash values for quick lookup.

```python
# List of user IDs with some duplicates
user_ids = ["user1", "user2", "user3", "user1", "user2", "user4"]

# Use a set to store unique user IDs
unique_user_ids = set()

for user_id in user_ids:
    unique_user_ids.add(user_id)

print(unique_user_ids)  # Output: {'user1', 'user2', 'user3', 'user4'}
```

### Example: Using Hash Values in a Dictionary

Dictionaries use hash values for keys to quickly retrieve values. This is particularly useful for implementing look-up tables or caches.

#### Example: Caching Results of Expensive Computations

Imagine you have a function that performs a computationally expensive operation. You can use a dictionary to cache the results of this function to avoid redundant computations.

```python
# Example of an expensive computation (e.g., factorial)
def expensive_computation(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result

# Dictionary to cache results
computation_cache = {}

def cached_computation(n):
    if n in computation_cache:
        print(f"Using cached value for {n}")
        return computation_cache[n]
    else:
        result = expensive_computation(n)
        computation_cache[n] = result
        return result

# Example usage
print(cached_computation(5))  # Computed and cached
print(cached_computation(5))  # Cached value used
```

Output:
```
120
Using cached value for 5
120
```

### Custom Objects with Hash Values

If you define your own classes, you can make instances hashable by implementing the `__hash__()` and `__eq__()` methods.

#### Example: Custom Class with Hashing

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.x, self.y))

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y

# Creating instances of Point
point1 = Point(1, 2)
point2 = Point(1, 2)
point3 = Point(2, 3)

# Using points in a set
points = {point1, point2, point3}
print(points)  # Output: {Point(1, 2), Point(2, 3)}

# Checking if points are considered equal
print(point1 == point2)  # Output: True
```
