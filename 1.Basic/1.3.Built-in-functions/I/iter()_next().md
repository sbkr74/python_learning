Certainly! Another real-life example involves processing data from a database. Let's consider a scenario where you need to process rows of data from a database query result set.

### Example: Processing Rows from a Database Query
Imagine you have a database table named `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `position`, and you want to process each row individually.

Here's how you could use `next()` to handle this in Python, assuming you're using the `sqlite3` module for database operations.

#### Setting Up the Database (SQLite)
First, let's create the database and insert some sample data.

```python
import sqlite3

# Create a new SQLite database (or connect to an existing one)
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT NOT NULL,
        position TEXT NOT NULL
    )
''')

# Insert some sample data
cursor.execute('INSERT INTO employees (name, position) VALUES (?, ?)', ('Alice', 'Engineer'))
cursor.execute('INSERT INTO employees (name, position) VALUES (?, ?)', ('Bob', 'Manager'))
cursor.execute('INSERT INTO employees (name, position) VALUES (?, ?)', ('Charlie', 'HR'))

# Commit the changes and close the connection setup
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

#### Python Code to Process Each Row Using `next()`
Now, let's write the code to query the database and process each row using `next()`.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query to select all rows from the employees table
cursor.execute('SELECT id, name, position FROM employees')

# Create an iterator from the cursor
row_iterator = iter(cursor)

# Process each row using next()
try:
    while True:
        row = next(row_iterator)
        # Process the row (for example, print it or perform other operations)
        print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}, Position: {row[2]}")
except StopIteration:
    # When StopIteration is raised, exit the loop
    pass

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation
- **Connecting to the database:** We connect to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.
- **Executing a query:** We execute a query to select all rows from the `employees` table.
- **Creating an iterator:** We create an iterator from the cursor object.
- **Using `next()`:** Inside a `try` block, we repeatedly call `next()` on the iterator to get the next row from the query result set.
- **Handling `StopIteration`:** When the result set is exhausted, `next()` raises a `StopIteration` exception, which we catch to exit the loop gracefully.

### Enhanced Example with Default Value
Let's enhance this example by providing a default value to `next()` to handle the case where there are no rows returned by the query.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query to select all rows from the employees table
cursor.execute('SELECT id, name, position FROM employees')

# Create an iterator from the cursor
row_iterator = iter(cursor)

# Process each row with a default message for no more rows
while True:
    row = next(row_iterator, None)
    if row is None:
        print("No more rows to process.")
        break
    print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}, Position: {row[2]}")

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Using a Custom Function to Process Rows
We can also use a custom function to process each row differently based on the position.

```python
def process_employee(row):
    if row[2] == 'Engineer':
        print("Engineer:", row[1])
    elif row[2] == 'Manager':
        print("Manager:", row[1])
    elif row[2] == 'HR':
        print("HR:", row[1])
    else:
        print("Unknown position:", row[1])

import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query to select all rows from the employees table
cursor.execute('SELECT id, name, position FROM employees')

# Create an iterator from the cursor
row_iterator = iter(cursor)

# Process each row with a custom function
while True:
    row = next(row_iterator, None)
    if row is None:
        break
    process_employee(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

### Summary
In this real-life example, `next()` is used to process rows from a database query result set one by one. This method allows for efficient, row-by-row processing of the data, making it a useful tool for handling large result sets or streaming data from a database query.
