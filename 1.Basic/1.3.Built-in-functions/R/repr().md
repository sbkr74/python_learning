The `repr()` function in Python is used to obtain the “official” string representation of an object. This representation is meant to be unambiguous and, ideally, should be such that `eval(repr(object)) == object` holds true. This makes `repr()` especially useful for debugging and logging, as it often provides more detailed information about an object compared to `str()`. 

Here are examples of using `repr()` in both basic and complex scenarios, as well as a real-life application:

### Basic Examples

1. **Simple Data Types:**
    ```python
    x = 123
    y = 3.14
    s = "Hello, world!"

    print(repr(x))  # Output: '123'
    print(repr(y))  # Output: '3.14'
    print(repr(s))  # Output: "'Hello, world!'"
    ```

2. **List:**
    ```python
    lst = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"]
    print(repr(lst))  # Output: '[1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana']'
    ```

### Complex Example

Consider a custom class in Python. Using `repr()` helps to provide a clear and detailed representation of objects of this class.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Person(name='{self.name}', age={self.age})"

# Create an instance of Person
person = Person("Alice", 30)

# Use repr() to get the official string representation
print(repr(person))  # Output: "Person(name='Alice', age=30)"
```

In this example, the `repr()` function is overridden in the `Person` class to provide a detailed and unambiguous string representation of the `Person` objects.

### Real-Life Application

Imagine a scenario where you are developing a complex application and need to log detailed information about various objects to diagnose issues. Using `repr()` can be highly beneficial.

```python
import datetime

class Transaction:
    def __init__(self, transaction_id, amount, date):
        self.transaction_id = transaction_id
        self.amount = amount
        self.date = date

    def __repr__(self):
        return (f"Transaction(transaction_id='{self.transaction_id}', "
                f"amount={self.amount}, date={repr(self.date)})")

# Create a transaction instance
transaction = Transaction("TXN12345", 250.75, datetime.datetime.now())

# Log the detailed information
log_entry = repr(transaction)
print(log_entry)
# Output: "Transaction(transaction_id='TXN12345', amount=250.75, date=datetime.datetime(2024, 6, 21, 14, 0, 0, 123456))"
```

In this real-life application, `repr()` is used to generate a detailed and unambiguous log entry for a `Transaction` object, which includes a nested `datetime` object. This ensures that the log entries are clear and informative, making debugging easier.
