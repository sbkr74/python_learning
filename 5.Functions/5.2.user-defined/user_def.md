## Functions
The functions created by a user for a particular task which is not predefined or built-in system function can be said as User Defined function.

### Defining a Function

A function is a reusable block of code or programming statements designed to perform a certain task. To define or declare a function, Python provides the _def_ keyword. The following is the syntax for defining a function. The function block of code is executed only if the function is called or invoked.

### Declaring and Calling a Function

When we make a function, we call it declaring a function. When we start using the it,  we call it *calling* or *invoking* a function. Function can be declared with or without parameters.

```py
# syntax
# Declaring a function
def function_name():
    codes
    codes
# Calling a function
function_name()
```
