# Learning the `re` Module in Python

## What is the `re` module?

`re` stands for "regular expressions" - it's like a super-powered search tool for text. Imagine you have a magic magnifying glass that can find words or patterns in a story!

## Getting Started

First, we need to tell Python we want to use this tool:

```python
import re
```

## Basic Searching

### 1. Finding a Word

Let's find if the word "cat" is in a sentence:

```python
sentence = "I have a cat and a dog."
result = re.search("cat", sentence)

if result:
    print("Found cat!")
else:
    print("No cat found.")
```

### 2. Finding at the Beginning

To check if a sentence starts with "Hello":

```python
greeting = "Hello, how are you?"
if re.match("Hello", greeting):
    print("It starts with Hello!")
```

## Special Symbols (Our Magic Tools)

### 1. The Dot (.) - Any Character

The dot is like a wildcard that can be any single character:

```python
# Finds "cat", "cot", "cut", etc.
re.search("c.t", "I have a cut on my finger.")
```

### 2. Star (*) - Zero or More Times

The star means "the character before me can appear many times or not at all":

```python
# Finds "ct", "cat", "caaat", etc.
re.search("ca*t", "Look at that caaaat!")
```

### 3. Plus (+) - One or More Times

Like star, but the character must appear at least once:

```python
# Finds "cat", "caat", but not "ct"
re.search("ca+t", "My ct is missing")  # Won't find anything
```

### 4. Question Mark (?) - Zero or One Time

The character before me is optional:

```python
# Finds "color" and "colour"
re.search("colou?r", "What color is it?")
```

## Finding All Matches

To find all matches, not just the first one:

```python
words = "cats, bats, hats, rats"
all_matches = re.findall(".ats", words)
print(all_matches)  # Output: ['cats', 'bats', 'hats', 'rats']
```

## Replacing Text

We can replace patterns too:

```python
sentence = "My phone number is 123-456-7890"
# Replace digits with X
hidden = re.sub(r"\d", "X", sentence)
print(hidden)  # Output: "My phone number is XXX-XXX-XXXX"
```

## Common Patterns

Here are some useful patterns:

1. `\d` - any digit (0-9)
2. `\w` - any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)
3. `\s` - any whitespace (space, tab, newline)
4. `[abc]` - matches a, b, or c
5. `[a-z]` - matches any lowercase letter

Here are some spicy, advanced regex patterns you can wield like a ninja with a keyboard ⚔️. They go beyond basic searches and help tackle real-world parsing, validation, and extraction problems:

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Lookahead and Lookbehind

### ✅ Positive Lookahead
```python
pattern = r"\w+(?=\sis)"
re.findall(pattern, "Knowledge is power. Time is money.")
```
**Output:** `['Knowledge', 'Time']`  
> Matches words that come **before** " is".

### ❌ Negative Lookbehind
```python
pattern = r"(?<!not\s)good"
re.findall(pattern, "This is not good. That is good.")
```
**Output:** `['good']`  
> Matches "good" only if it’s *not* preceded by "not ".

---

## 🔄 Backreferences and Groups

### 📦 Duplicate Words
```python
pattern = r"\b(\w+)\s+\1\b"
re.findall(pattern, "I saw a a dog. The the cat ran.")
```
**Output:** `['a', 'the']`  
> Finds **repeated words**.

---

## 🔤 Character Classes and Anchors

### 🎯 Start and End of Line
```python
pattern = r"^Hello|world$"
re.findall(pattern, "Hello there, brave new world")
```
**Output:** `['Hello', 'world']`  
> Matches "Hello" only if it’s at the beginning, and "world" at the end.

---

## 🪪 Validation-Like Patterns

### 🔢 Valid IPv4 Address
```python
pattern = r"\b(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b"
re.findall(pattern, "My IP is 192.168.0.1 and router is 10.0.0.254")
```
**Output:** `['192.168.0.1', '10.0.0.254']`  
> Matches IP-like structures (but doesn’t enforce range limits).

---

## 🧬 Recursive and Complex Extraction

### 🧩 Extract Content Between Balanced Quotes
```python
pattern = r'"(.*?)"'
re.findall(pattern, 'She said "hello" and then "goodbye".')
```
**Output:** `['hello', 'goodbye']`  
> Captures **quoted content**, even if nested minimalistically.
