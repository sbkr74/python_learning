# Learning the `re` Module in Python

## What is the `re` module?

`re` stands for "regular expressions" - it's like a super-powered search tool for text. Imagine you have a magic magnifying glass that can find words or patterns in a story!

## Getting Started

First, we need to tell Python we want to use this tool:

```python
import re
```

## Basic Searching

### 1. Finding a Word

Let's find if the word "cat" is in a sentence:

```python
sentence = "I have a cat and a dog."
result = re.search("cat", sentence)

if result:
    print("Found cat!")
else:
    print("No cat found.")
```

### 2. Finding at the Beginning

To check if a sentence starts with "Hello":

```python
greeting = "Hello, how are you?"
if re.match("Hello", greeting):
    print("It starts with Hello!")
```

## Special Symbols (Our Magic Tools)

### 1. The Dot (.) - Any Character

The dot is like a wildcard that can be any single character:

```python
# Finds "cat", "cot", "cut", etc.
re.search("c.t", "I have a cut on my finger.")
```

### 2. Star (*) - Zero or More Times

The star means "the character before me can appear many times or not at all":

```python
# Finds "ct", "cat", "caaat", etc.
re.search("ca*t", "Look at that caaaat!")
```

### 3. Plus (+) - One or More Times

Like star, but the character must appear at least once:

```python
# Finds "cat", "caat", but not "ct"
re.search("ca+t", "My ct is missing")  # Won't find anything
```

### 4. Question Mark (?) - Zero or One Time

The character before me is optional:

```python
# Finds "color" and "colour"
re.search("colou?r", "What color is it?")
```

## Finding All Matches

To find all matches, not just the first one:

```python
words = "cats, bats, hats, rats"
all_matches = re.findall(".ats", words)
print(all_matches)  # Output: ['cats', 'bats', 'hats', 'rats']
```

## Replacing Text

We can replace patterns too:

```python
sentence = "My phone number is 123-456-7890"
# Replace digits with X
hidden = re.sub(r"\d", "X", sentence)
print(hidden)  # Output: "My phone number is XXX-XXX-XXXX"
```

## Common Patterns

Here are some useful patterns:

1. `\d` - any digit (0-9)
2. `\w` - any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)
3. `\s` - any whitespace (space, tab, newline)
4. `[abc]` - matches a, b, or c
5. `[a-z]` - matches any lowercase letter
