## Decorators
Decorators are the most common use of higher-order functions in Python. It allows programmers to modify the behavior of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. In Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and then called inside the wrapper function.
