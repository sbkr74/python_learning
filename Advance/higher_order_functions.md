A higher-order function in Python is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments, returns a function as its result, or both. These functions allow for more abstract and concise code and are a fundamental concept in functional programming.

### Characteristics of Higher-Order Functions

1. **Takes one or more functions as arguments:**
   Higher-order functions can accept functions as parameters, allowing them to be more flexible and reusable.

2. **Returns a function:**
   They can also return a function, which enables the creation of function generators and more dynamic behavior.

### Common Higher-Order Functions in Python

Python provides several built-in higher-order functions. Here are some examples:

1. **map():**
   Applies a given function to all items in an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (an iterator).

   ```python
   def square(x):
       return x * x

   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)
   print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
   ```

2. **filter():**
   Constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.

   ```python
   def is_even(x):
       return x % 2 == 0

   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   even_numbers = filter(is_even, numbers)
   print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
   ```

3. **reduce():**
   Applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in an iterable. Note that `reduce()` is not a built-in function in Python 3 and needs to be imported from the `functools` module.

   ```python
   from functools import reduce

   def add(x, y):
       return x + y

   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   sum_of_numbers = reduce(add, numbers)
   print(sum_of_numbers)  # Output: 15
   ```

### Creating Your Own Higher-Order Functions

You can also create your own higher-order functions. Here's an example that demonstrates both taking a function as an argument and returning a function.

```python
def apply_function_twice(func, value):
    return func(func(value))

def increment(x):
    return x + 1

result = apply_function_twice(increment, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 7

def create_multiplier(multiplier):
    def multiply(x):
        return x * multiplier
    return multiply

double = create_multiplier(2)
print(double(5))  # Output: 10
```

In this example:
- `apply_function_twice` is a higher-order function that takes a function `func` and a value, applying the function to the value twice.
- `create_multiplier` is a higher-order function that returns a new function configured to multiply its input by the specified `multiplier`.

Here are two versions of the higher-order function: one using `filter()` and another using `reduce()`, without using lambda functions.

### Using `filter()`

For the `filter()` version, we'll create a helper function to check if an element's index is within the first `n` elements:

```python
def take_n_items_filter(n):
    def first_n_items(lst):
        def within_first_n(item):
            return lst.index(item) < n
        return list(filter(within_first_n, lst))
    return first_n_items

# Create a function that takes the first 10 items
take_10_items_filter = take_n_items_filter(10)

# Example usage
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
first_ten_filter = take_10_items_filter(my_list)
print(first_ten_filter)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

### Using `reduce()`

For the `reduce()` version, we'll create a helper function to accumulate the first `n` elements:

```python
from functools import reduce

def take_n_items_reduce(n):
    def first_n_items(lst):
        def reducer(acc, item):
            if len(acc) < n:
                acc.append(item)
            return acc
        return reduce(reducer, lst, [])
    return first_n_items

# Create a function that takes the first 10 items
take_10_items_reduce = take_n_items_reduce(10)

# Example usage
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
first_ten_reduce = take_10_items_reduce(my_list)
print(first_ten_reduce)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

### Summary

- The `filter()` version uses a helper function `within_first_n` to check if an element's index is within the first `n` elements.
- The `reduce()` version uses a helper function `reducer` to accumulate the first `n` elements into a list.

Both approaches achieve the goal without using lambda functions.

Higher-order functions are powerful tools in Python, enabling more abstract, reusable, and concise code.
