The `keyboard` module in Python allows you to control and monitor keyboard events programmatically. Hereâ€™s a basic guide on how to use it:

### Installation
First, install the module using pip:
```bash
pip install keyboard
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Simulate Key Presses:**
   You can simulate key presses with `keyboard.press()`, `keyboard.release()`, or `keyboard.write()` to type text.

   ```python
   import keyboard

   # Simulate pressing and releasing a key
   keyboard.press('a')
   keyboard.release('a')

   # Type a full string
   keyboard.write('Hello, World!')
   ```

2. **Detect Key Presses:**
   You can monitor when a key is pressed using `keyboard.is_pressed()`.

   ```python
   if keyboard.is_pressed('q'):
       print('You pressed the "q" key!')
   ```

3. **Add Hotkeys:**
   You can bind functions to specific key combinations using `keyboard.add_hotkey()`.

   ```python
   # Define a function that will be called when 'ctrl + shift + a' is pressed
   def hotkey_action():
       print("Hotkey pressed!")

   # Bind the hotkey
   keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+shift+a', hotkey_action)
   ```

4. **Record Key Events:**
   You can record and replay key presses.

   ```python
   # Record until 'esc' is pressed
   events = keyboard.record(until='esc')

   # Replay the recorded events
   keyboard.play(events)
   ```

5. **Wait for a Specific Key:**
   The `keyboard.wait()` function allows you to pause execution until a certain key is pressed.

   ```python
   # Wait until 'enter' is pressed
   keyboard.wait('enter')
   print("Enter was pressed!")
   ```

### Notes:
- The `keyboard` module requires administrator privileges to capture or simulate keystrokes globally (outside the Python script).
- It works only on Windows and Linux (does not support macOS natively).
