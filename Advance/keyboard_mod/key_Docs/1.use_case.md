Here's an example demonstrating more advanced use cases for the `keyboard` module, including hotkeys, event handling, and key logging:

### Example: Hotkeys, Event Handling, and Key Logging

```python
import keyboard
import time

# Function to be called when a specific hotkey is pressed
def on_hotkey_press():
    print("Hotkey 'ctrl+shift+a' activated!")

# Adding a hotkey: ctrl+shift+a
keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+shift+a', on_hotkey_press)

# Function to log pressed keys and stop on 'esc'
def log_keys():
    print("Logging started. Press 'esc' to stop.")
    recorded_events = []
    while True:
        event = keyboard.read_event()  # Read key press or release
        if event.event_type == keyboard.KEY_DOWN:
            print(f"Key '{event.name}' pressed")
            recorded_events.append(event.name)
        if event.name == 'esc':
            print("Logging stopped.")
            break
    return recorded_events

# Start logging key events in a separate thread (non-blocking)
keyboard.start_recording()

# Wait for a specific key or a hotkey event in the main thread
print("Press any key to continue or activate the hotkey (ctrl+shift+a) to trigger a function.")
keyboard.wait('esc')

# Stop recording and retrieve events
events = keyboard.stop_recording()

# Output the recorded key events
print("Recorded key events:", [event.name for event in events])

# Optionally, replay the recorded events
keyboard.play(events)

# Delay for demo purposes
time.sleep(2)
print("Program finished.")
```

### Explanation of Code:
1. **Hotkey Binding (`keyboard.add_hotkey()`)**:
   - When you press `ctrl+shift+a`, the `on_hotkey_press()` function is called.

2. **Key Logging (`keyboard.read_event()`)**:
   - Captures individual key events (`key down` and `key up`).
   - It continues logging until the `esc` key is pressed.

3. **Recording and Replaying (`keyboard.start_recording()` / `keyboard.stop_recording()`)**:
   - The script logs all key presses while you run it. After stopping the recording with `esc`, you can replay the events using `keyboard.play()`.

### Practical Use Cases:
- **Hotkeys for Automation**: You can automate repetitive tasks by binding specific key combinations to functions.
- **Key Loggers**: Logging all keys could be useful for debugging or in a controlled environment to monitor user input.
- **Simulating User Input**: Useful for testing user interfaces by simulating keystrokes.

This example demonstrates how you can use the `keyboard` module to handle various tasks, including detecting specific hotkey combinations, logging keystrokes, and simulating keyboard input.
